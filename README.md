# Conzept encyclopedia

Conzept is an attempt to create an **encyclopedia for the 21st century**. A modern topic-exploration tool based on: Wikipedia, Wikidata, the Open Library, Archive.org, YouTube, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and many other information sources. A semantic web app build for fun, education and research.

Conzept allows you to explore any of the millions of topics on Wikipedia from many different angles - such as science, art, digital books and education - both as a defined semantic entity ("a thing") as well as a string.

Client-side topic-classification in addition allows for a fast, higher-level logic throughout the whole user experience. Conzept also has an uniquely integrated user-interface, which gives you a single well-designed view of all this information (in any of the 300+ Wikipedia languages), with less cognitive load.

This project has been funded by the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/Conzept/) (backed by the [NGI4eu](https://www.ngi.eu/) and [EU Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/) vision and funds). Thank you for this support!
