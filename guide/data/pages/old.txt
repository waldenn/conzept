  * iPhone:
    - bold link activation not persistent across page loads.
    - add more bottom space to any list view
    - Links and backlink view gives same results??

===== prio 3 issues =====

  * rarely, but sometimes the ToC list (of first-order headers) is very long, causing some header items not to be visible. Possible solutions:
    * aside: overflow-y: none
    * make header-items-height a bit smaller
    * examples: [[explore>List of animals in the Bible|1]], ...

  * for wikipedia-content-panes: also add a bookmark-icon to the top-right-corner (alongside the "explore this" and "wikipedia" button)

  * add a [[https://zellwk.com/blog/creating-focus-style/|custom focus style]] to interactive UI elements (which currently don't have any focus style)

  * refractor CSS with mobile as the default

  * first H1 should be moved up in desktop-view, but not in the mobile-view.

  * in desktop view: when making dragging the content-pane over the sidebar, the logo-header and randombuttom are displayed on top.

  * how to implement "toggle-fullscreen" from an iframe? (browser security issue)

  * get true iframe-url for internal sites (so the breakout button works correctly)

    * implement darkmode in iframe-apps: wikidata-graphs, wikidata-timelines, geo
    * in darkmode this [[https://conze.pt/explore/Inner%20German%20border?l=en&t=wikipedia&s=true&i=700754|article]], goes blank (something is exiting the wikipedia-rendering process, openseadragon issue?)

  * when the leftpane is first minimized and then manually (by dragging) enlarged again, the sticky-menu should be shown again.

  * font-switching not applied to the current window-panes on mobile

  * hash-string-with-special-characters breaks targeting: [[https://conze.pt/explore/Empresa%20Municipal%20de%20Transportes%20de%20Madrid?l=es#v%C3%A9ase_tambi%C3%A9n|example]]

  * query-term with an encoded forward-slash is mis-interpreted as URL-path-separator: [[https://conze.pt/explore/Portal:Contents%2FPortals?l=en&t=wikipedia&p=1|example]]

  * unable to prevent the drag-and-drop from triggering the autocomplete-menu?

  * for wikipedia-articles with a main geocode, show it on the page.

  * how to handle queries to specific [[https://conze.pt/explore/keshava%20bhat?l=en&m=video|video-title-requests]] that also return wikipedia results?

  * dynamic ToC issue: can the aside scrollbar be sized dynamically by only accounting for all the visible item-heights?

  * wikipedia hierarchical ("multiple-stars at beginning of line") list is represented as a flat list, example: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_knowledge|wikipedia]], [[https://conze.pt/explore/Outline%20of%20knowledge?l=en|explore]]

  * allow [[https://conze.pt/explore/Category:17th-century Danish composers|categories]] to display their "super/sub/inner-pages relations" to be displayed in list-links

  * image formatting sometimes incorrect:

=====technical principles=====

  * 1) URL-params are only used for "initial parameter state loading" and "follow up user-presentation-state" (for visual representation and linking)
    * TODO: reset URL-related fields upon each each call to onClick / handleClick
  * 2) any link/button actions should contain ALL the required data (but nothing else!), when making a call to handleClick()
    * what about "type"-continuation?
  * 3) clicking on a link/button should update the URL correctly and ignore representing unneeded fields
