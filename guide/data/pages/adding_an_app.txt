====== adding an app ======

It is easy to integrate any existing (and future) statically-build web application into Conzept.

**Due to Conzepts use of iframes within the content panes, the execution and styling context of the app is completely isolated.** Yet it is still easy to communicate with the iframed app via its URL-parameters (and when needed triggering postMessage() calls in its JS code).

To add an extra app to the existing set of apps, these things need to be done:

  * First **copy the app** to a directory in Conzept ($CONZEPT_WEB_DIR/app/<your_app_name>/)

  * Often you'll want to **modify the app, to have it make use of some extra URL parameters**, such as: the topic title, content language, Wikidata Qid or something else. In most applications this can easily be done.

  * Optional: Add the Conzept common HTML/CSS/JS resources to the app:
    * Copy the "index.html" to index.template.html (or the "index.php" to "index.template.php", for PHP apps)
    * Insert the following template snippet into the HTML page, which will get substituted during the build step: **CONZEPT_COMMON_HTML_INCLUDE**. (If the project already includes jQuery, use: **CONZEPT_COMMON_HTML_INCLUDE_NO_JQUERY**)

  * Then **add a new [[field_customization|field]] definition**, to create a link to this specific app. Here is a simple example, which adds a link in two sections:

<code>
'my_app_name' : {
  create_condition: true,
  title: 'My App Name',
  prop: '',
  type: 'link',
  mv: false,
  url: '${explore.base}/app/myapp/?q=${title_quoted}',
  mv: false,
  icon: 'fas fa-flask',
  text: 'My App Name',
  section: ['science-chemistry','main'],
  rank: [100,10000],
},
</code>

  * Run "**npm run build**" to rebuild the Conzept system. The new app should now be linked up in the topic results.
